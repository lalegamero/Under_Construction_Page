#  Project - Under Construction Page

This is a simple HTML document, designed to be used as a temporary home page when developing a website. This is a great way to start a web development project.

This starter project is also a collection of things/plugins I have learned over the years and code snippets I have created and other that were collected from other people who are smarter than me to make soemthing I really enjoy using.

## System Preparation

To use this starter project, you'll need the following things installed on your machine.

1. [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/) in order to run javascript on the console, you can go to the NodeJS site and follow trough the installation process.
2. After you get the node command on the console you will have the node package manager [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) as well.
3. Now you need to install [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp): `npm install -g gulp`

Gulp is the one that will run all the compilation, watchers and others tasks.

## Installation
To start using the project, clone this repo to your computer. You can download the the zip version.

After you have it on your pc, you need to go in the console to the project folder and execute the following command to gather all the dependencies.

`npm install`

## Usage
Once you have the project open you should be able to open your terminal and type `gulp` in the command line.

This will give you file watching, browser synchronisation, auto-rebuild, CSS injecting (autoprefixers and Sass compilation).

After that go ahead and follow these steps:

1. Edit index.html.
2. Optionally, modify the elements and the style according to your needs.
3. Upload the file to the root directory of your website, or configure your GitHub Pages site.

Feel free to add onto this project by forking it and making it your own. This is just a basic start but work for most basic project without a lot of fancy bells and whistles.

Enjoy! :metal:
